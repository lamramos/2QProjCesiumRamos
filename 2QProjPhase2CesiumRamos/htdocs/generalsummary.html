    After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes of Europe became more powerful. They created states
	in what was once Rome. After some time, these states became Francia. This was succeeded by the Holy Roman Empire, a state
	composed of German States of varying size and influence. Among these states, Prussia and Austria emerged as the most
	powerful. After several wars under the guidance of Otto von Bismarck, Prussia unified with several other small states 
	to form the North German Confederation. They went to war with France in 1870, ultimately winning. They united with all 
	the other states (except Austria) and annexed the region of Alsace-Lorraine. This resulted in the renaming of the 
	Confederation to the German Empire on the 10th of December 1871. Wilhelm I was proclaimed Emperor on the 18th of January 
	1871 in the Palace of Versailles. After Wilhelm I passed away, he was replaced by Friedrich III, who died 99 days after
	his accession to the throne. He was replaced by Wilhelm II. In 1914, Germany joined the side of Austria-Hungary against Serbia,
	France and others. They surrendered on the 11th of November 1918 at 11:00 AM. In 1919, the monarchy was replaced by a republic,
    known to modern historians as the Weimar Republic. During the Great Depression, the Republic suffered heavily. A charismatic
	politician by the name of Adolf Hitler and his party, the NSDAP, gained popularity. In 1933, the Reichstag burned. Hitler 
	used this opportunity to take power and rule with his party until 1945. In 1939, Germany started World War II by invading 
	Poland. The war in Europe ended in May of 1945. The eastern half of Germany was given to Poland while the Western half was
	split into 4 zones, those being the British, American, French and Soviet zones. The British, American and French zones 
	became East Germany while the Soviet zone stayed in the Eastern Bloc as East Germany. In 1990, East Germany, like other Eastern
	Bloc countries, left the influence of the USSR and reunited with West Germany, forming the Federal Republic of Germany that we
	know today.
